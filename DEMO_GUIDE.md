- Smooth animations for all window movements
- Intelligent window lifecycle management
- Comprehensive status reporting

### 3. ðŸ§ª Basic Dynamic Grid Test
**File:** `test_dynamic_grid.rs`  
**Run:** `test_dynamic_grid.bat` or `cargo run --bin test_dynamic_grid`

**Features:**
- Testing different grid configurations
- Grid bounds checking
- Basic window management functionality

## Key Differences

### Animated Transitions vs Comprehensive Management

| Feature | Animated Transitions | Comprehensive Management |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Window Selection | Works with first N windows | **ALL visible windows** |
| Window Rotation | Fixed window set through grids | **Dynamic in/out rotation** |
| New Windows | Not handled during demo | **Real-time discovery & integration** |
| Unused Windows | Stay in last position | **Return to original positions** |
| Lifecycle | Static window set | **Full window lifecycle management** |

## Usage Recommendations

### For Animation Testing
Use **Animated Transitions Demo** if you want to:
- Test smooth animation quality
- Demonstrate easing functions
- Show basic grid layout capabilities
- Focus on animation performance

### For Real-World Window Management
Use **Comprehensive Window Management Demo** if you want to:
- **Manage all windows on your desktop**
- **See dynamic window discovery in action**
- **Test real-world scenarios with opening/closing windows**
- **Experience intelligent window rotation and restoration**
- **Demonstrate production-ready window management**

## How to Use

1. **Save your work** - These demos will move all your windows around
2. **Choose your demo** based on what you want to test
3. **Run the batch script** for easier execution with warnings
4. **Follow the prompts** - Each demo has pause points for user interaction
5. **Open new windows** during the Comprehensive demo to see them get integrated

## Technical Details

- **Frame Rate:** 60 FPS for smooth animations
- **Window Discovery:** Real-time using Windows API `EnumWindows`
- **Animation Engine:** Custom easing functions with interpolation
- **Memory Management:** Automatic cleanup of closed windows
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid window handles

## Demo Flow - Comprehensive Management

1. **Discovery Phase** - Scans all visible windows
2. **2x2 Grid** - Arranges first 4 windows, others restored to original positions
3. **Window Rotation** - Rotates windows through grid cells
4. **4x4 Grid** - Expands to 16 cells, more windows join grid
5. **6x6 Grid** - Large grid showing many windows at once
6. **3x3 Grid** - Contracts back, excess windows return home
7. **Restoration** - All windows return to original positions

The **Comprehensive Window Management Demo** represents the most advanced and complete implementation of the E-Grid system, showcasing true dynamic window management capabilities.
