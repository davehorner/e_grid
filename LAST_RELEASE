## [0.1.6](https://github.com/davehorner/e_grid/compare/v0.1.5...v0.1.6) - 2025-07-12

### Fixed

- *(e_grid_all)* stop chrome tooltips from being seen as toplevel windows.  if a window doesn't size, at least translate and set window z-order to bottom. fixed issue with focus being driven to initial focused window.
