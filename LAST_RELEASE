### Other

- *(events)* add continuous move/resize event tracking and client callbacks  - Introduced new `GridEvent` variants: `WindowMove` and `WindowResize` for granular tracking of continuous gestures. - Added corresponding event type constants and utility functions for consistent encoding/decoding. - Updated `GridClient` to support `move_callback` and `resize_callback` handlers for real-time event consumption. - Enhanced `win_event_proc` to emit continuous move and resize events during window gesture operations. - Refactored server/client `grid_event_to_window_event` logic to use `grid_event_type_code` mapping. - Silenced some debug prints for cleaner logs during regular use.
