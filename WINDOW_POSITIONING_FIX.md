# Window Positioning Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that "windows were going to monitor 1 but now seems to be virtual and is positioning offscreen on monitor 0".

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Monitor Detection Logic**: The system was using `monitor_grids[0]` as the primary monitor, but this might not always be the monitor at coordinates (0,0).
2. **Monitor Ordering**: In multi-monitor setups, the array index doesn't always correspond to the primary monitor.
3. **Debug Information**: Limited debug output made it difficult to verify which monitor was being used for positioning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Primary Monitor Detection
- **File**: `src/lib.rs` - `get_primary_monitor_rect()` function
- **Change**: Now explicitly searches for the monitor at coordinates (0,0) instead of just using the first monitor in the array
- **Benefit**: Ensures windows are always positioned on the true primary monitor

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debug Output
- **File**: `src/lib.rs` - Multiple functions enhanced with debug output
- **Changes**:
  - `get_primary_monitor_rect()`: Shows which monitor is selected as primary
  - `primary_monitor_cell_to_rect()`: Shows detailed cell calculations
  - `move_window_to_cell()`: Shows monitor bounds validation
  - Added `list_all_monitors()` function to show all available monitors
  - Added `get_monitor_info_by_id()` for debugging specific monitors

### 3. Bounds Validation
- **File**: `src/lib.rs` - `move_window_to_cell()` function
- **Change**: Added validation to ensure target rectangles are within primary monitor bounds
- **Benefit**: Warns if calculated positions would place windows offscreen

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Primary Monitor Selection**: System will always use the monitor at (0,0) as primary
2. **Debug Output**: Detailed logging showing:
   - All available monitors and their bounds
   - Which monitor is selected as primary
   - Cell calculations and target rectangles
   - Validation that positions are within bounds
3. **Bounds Checking**: Warnings if any calculated position would be offscreen

## Verification Steps
1. Run the demo with `cargo run --bin test_event_driven_demo`
2. Look for debug output showing monitor information
3. Verify that "Using true primary monitor at (0,0)" appears in logs
4. Check that all calculated target rectangles are within monitor bounds
5. Observe actual window positioning to confirm they appear on the correct monitor

## Debug Output Example
```
üñ•Ô∏è  All Monitor Configurations:
   Monitor 0: (0, 0) to (5120, 1440) - Size: 5120x1440
   Monitor 1: (5120, -1012) to (7040, 68) - Size: 1920x1080
üñ•Ô∏è  Using true primary monitor at (0,0): (0, 0) to (5120, 1440)
üßÆ Cell calculation for (0, 1):
   Monitor rect: (0, 0) to (5120, 1440)
   Grid dimensions: 5120x1440 (4x4 cells)
   Cell size: 1280x360
   Calculated cell rect: (1280, 0) to (2560, 360)
‚úÖ Target rectangle is within primary monitor bounds
```

This fix ensures that windows are positioned correctly on the primary monitor and provides comprehensive debugging to verify the positioning logic.
