----------------------
To generate a better conventional commit message based on the changes you made, consider using the following refined prompt:

---

**Prompt:**

Generate a conventional commit message based on the following changes made in the specified files. Ensure that the message adheres to the conventional commit specifications, including the type, a concise description, and references to the affected files or components.

**Changed Files:**
- `src/lib.rs`

**Changes:**
- Introduced a new enum `CellState` to represent different states of grid cells (Empty, Occupied, OffScreen).
- Created a struct `MonitorGrid` to manage the layout of windows on each monitor.
- Implemented methods for `MonitorGrid`, including initialization and updating grid cells based on window locations.
- Modified `WindowTracker` to include individual `MonitorGrid` instances for each monitor and updated how windows are managed across multiple monitors.
- Improved the grid display with representations for different states of cells.

This prompt provides all necessary context to help generate a coherent and complete conventional commit message that accurately reflects the changes made.


----------------------
To generate a clearer conventional commit message that aligns with the specifications, use the following prompt:

**Prompt:**

"Please write a conventional commit message that summarizes the changes made in the recent commit, including references to the modified files. The message should include a type (e.g., feat, fix, chore), a subject line that describes the changes in a concise manner, and detail any specific functionality introduced or bugs fixed related to the changes in `src/lib.rs`. Remember to follow the proper format, starting with the type and scope (if applicable), followed by a colon and a brief description." 

**Example Format:**
`<type>[optional scope]: <subject>`

Make sure to adapt the prompt as needed for other programming contexts or specific conventions you might want to highlight!


----------------------
To generate a better conventional commit message, it's helpful to provide context about the nature of the changes made in the code. Here’s an improved prompt to obtain a commit message that adheres to conventional commit specifications:

---

**Prompt:**

Please write a conventional commit message that includes a summary of the changes, references the modified files, and categorizes the update according to the conventional commit format (e.g., feat, fix, chore). 

Consider the following context from the changes made in the code:

- A new data structure `MonitorGrid` was introduced to manage the arrangement of windows across multiple monitors.
- Added methods to initialize monitor grids and update window positions on these grids.
- Introduced a new enum `CellState` to represent the state of each cell within the grid (i.e., `Empty`, `Occupied`, `OffScreen`).
- Enhanced the `WindowTracker` struct to maintain individual grids for each monitor.

The modified files include:
- `src/lib.rs`

---

With this improved prompt, the focus is placed on the specific types of changes that have been made, encouraging a commit message that is descriptive and follows the conventional style. This will assist in maintaining a clear and consistent commit history.


----------------------
Here’s an improved prompt to generate a more informative conventional commit message that follows the conventional commit specifications:

---

**Prompt:**

Please provide a conventional commit message detailing your changes to the files based on the provided `diff`. Ensure that your message adheres to the conventional commit specification, which typically includes:

1. **Type**: Specify the type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`).
2. **Scope**: Optionally, include the scope of the change in parentheses (e.g., `package`, `component`).
3. **Description**: A brief description summarizing the change.
4. **Breaking Changes**: If applicable, mention any breaking changes.
5. **Reference**: Include references to any relevant issues or further context.

For instance, if you are updating dependencies in the `Cargo.lock` file and modifying associated modules, your commit message could look like this:

```
feat(deps): update dependencies in Cargo.lock

Updated the version of several crates including `iceoryx2`, `serde`, and others in `Cargo.lock`, improving functionality and performance. This change may affect associated modules that depend on these updates.

Refer to [issue #123](link_to_issue) for more details.
```

Using the information from the `diff`, please generate an appropriate conventional commit message.

This prompt instructs the user on how to format the message diligently while providing an example. It helps ensure clarity and adherence to the conventional commit guidelines.


----------------------
To ensure the generation of a conventional commit message that adheres to the conventional commit specifications and accurately references the changes made in the files, you can use the following improved prompt:

---

**Prompt:**

"Create a conventional commit message that summarizes the changes made in the `Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.toml`, and new files in the `src` directory. The changes include updates to dependencies, added IPC functionality in `ipc.rs`, and the introduction of additional features in `ipc_demo.rs` and `ipc_demo_new.rs`. Follow the conventional commit format, such as `feat`, `fix`, or `chore`, and ensure to mention the added and updated packages as well as any significant new functionalities or modifications introduced in the code files."

---

This prompt encourages the generation of a clear and descriptive commit message that adheres to the guidelines and captures the important aspects of the changes made.


----------------------
To create an effective conventional commit message from the provided code changes, it's important to adhere to the conventional commits specification format. This format includes a type, an optional scope, and a description of the change. 

Your prompt should provide clear guidance on how to frame a commit message based on the changes made in the code. Here’s an improved prompt:

### Improved Commit Message Prompt

**Please create a conventional commit message based on the following changes in the code:**

1. **Added new dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:**
   - `iceoryx2` version 0.6.1
   - `serde` with derive feature for serialization and deserialization.

2. **Modified `Cargo.lock`:** 
   - Updated various dependencies, including `winapi`, `serde`, and added many new packages such as `either`, `bitflags`, `cc`, etc.

3. **Created new source files:** 
   - `src/ipc.rs`: New IPC functionality with Iceoryx integration to manage window events using a publisher/subscriber model.
   - `src/ipc_demo.rs`: Demo client for IPC, subscribing to services.
   - `src/ipc_demo_new.rs`: An enhanced demo client with improved command input handling.
   - Introduced `src/ipc_test.rs` for testing IPC functionality.

4. **Refactored other existing files** to improve the organization and make events handling more modular under `src/window_events.rs`.

**Make sure to include the type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`), a succinct description, and reference any relevant files or packages that were modified.**

### Expected Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
