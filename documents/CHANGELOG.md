## [Unreleased]

### Added - Focus Event Tracking System
- **üéØ Complete Focus Event Integration**: Main e_grid server (`ipc_server_demo`) now publishes comprehensive focus events
  - **FOCUSED events** (event_type: 0) when windows gain focus
  - **DEFOCUSED events** (event_type: 1) when windows lose focus
  - Real-time focus change detection via Windows WinEvent hooks
  - Process ID, window title, and hash-based identification
  - Timestamp tracking for event ordering

- **üèóÔ∏è IPC Service Infrastructure**: 
  - New `GRID_FOCUS_EVENTS_SERVICE` for publishing `WindowFocusEvent` messages
  - Multi-client support (up to 8 simultaneous subscribers)
  - Message history and buffering for late-joining clients
  - Graceful client connect/disconnect handling

- **üì° Server-Side Focus Tracking**:
  - Added `focus_publisher` field to `GridIpcServer` struct
  - Added `last_focused_window` tracking for focus transition detection
  - Enhanced `handle_window_event()` to publish both focus and defocus events
  - Automatic focus state management with Windows API integration

- **üß™ Testing and Demo Infrastructure**:
  - Created `test_focus_defocus.bat` for easy end-to-end testing
  - Created `test_focus_integration.bat` for server-client validation
  - Enhanced existing focus demo examples to work with main server
  - Updated `examples/README.md` with comprehensive focus tracking documentation

### Enhanced
- **üîß Server Architecture**: Enhanced main e_grid server to support focus events alongside existing grid management features
- **üìã Service Registration**: Updated service initialization to include focus events service
- **üñ•Ô∏è Multi-Client Support**: All IPC services now support up to 8 concurrent clients with individual buffering

### Technical Details
- **Focus Event Structure**: `WindowFocusEvent` with event_type, hwnd, process_id, timestamp, app_name_hash, window_title_hash
- **Hash-Based Identification**: Simple but effective string hashing for app and window identification
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Focus event publishing from WinEvent callbacks with minimal processing
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight focus detection with no expensive operations in event callbacks

### Breaking Changes
- None - All changes are additive and backward compatible

### Migration Guide
- **Existing Users**: No changes required - all existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Focus Tracking Users**: Can now use main server (`cargo run --bin ipc_server_demo`) instead of standalone `focus_demo_server`
- **New Users**: Recommended to use main server for all use cases as it provides complete e_grid functionality plus focus tracking
