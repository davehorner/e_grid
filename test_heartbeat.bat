echo Testing E-Grid Heartbeat & Graceful Shutdown
echo ===============================================
echo.
echo This test demonstrates:
echo  ðŸ’“ Server sending heartbeat messages every second
echo  ðŸ’“ Client receiving heartbeats to stay connected  
echo  ðŸ›‘ Graceful shutdown when server console is closed
echo  ðŸ“¡ Client detecting server shutdown via special heartbeat
echo.

echo 1. Starting e_grid server with heartbeat support...
start "E-Grid Server with Heartbeat" cmd /c "cd /d c:\w\e_grid && cargo run --bin ipc_server_demo"

echo 2. Waiting 3 seconds for server to initialize...
timeout /t 3 /nobreak >nul

echo 3. Starting e_grid client with heartbeat handling...
start "E-Grid Client with Heartbeat" cmd /c "cd /d c:\w\e_grid && cargo run --bin grid_client_demo"

echo.
echo âœ… Both processes started!
echo.
echo ðŸ§ª Test Instructions:
echo ==================
echo  1. Watch both consoles - you should see:
echo     - Server: "ðŸ’“ Server heartbeat - iteration X" every second
echo     - Client: Staying connected (no false disconnects)
echo.
echo  2. To test graceful shutdown:
echo     - Click the [X] close button on the SERVER window
echo     - Watch the CLIENT detect the shutdown gracefully
echo.
echo  3. Expected behavior:
echo     - Server sends shutdown heartbeat before closing
echo     - Client receives shutdown signal and exits gracefully
echo     - No false "server disconnected" errors during operation
echo.
echo Press any key to continue...
