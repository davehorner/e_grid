# Log-Based TUI Output Containment - Summary

## Problem Solved
The real-time monitor was experiencing "frame breaking" where GridClient output was printing to stdout and breaking out of the ratatui TUI panels.

## Solution Implemented
Instead of trying to suppress stdout (which is complex on Windows), we converted the GridClient to use the `log` crate with proper logging levels.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added to Cargo.toml
- `log = "0.4"` - Core logging framework
- `env_logger = "0.11"` - Environment-based log configuration

### 2. Real-time Monitor (realtime_monitor_grid.rs)
- Added log import: `use log::{info, debug, warn, error};`
- Initialized logging in main() with error level filter to minimize TUI disruption:
  ```rust
  std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "error");
  env_logger::init();
  ```

### 3. GridClient (src/ipc_client.rs)
- Added log import: `use log::{info, debug, warn, error};`
- Converted key `println!` statements to appropriate log levels:
  - `println!("⚙️ ...")` → `debug!("⚙️ ...")` (less important debug info)
  - `println!("✅ ...")` → `info!("✅ ...")` (successful operations)
  - `println!("⚠️ ...")` → `warn!("⚠️ ...")` (warnings)
  - `println!("❌ ...")` → `error!("❌ ...")` (errors)

## Key Conversions
- Configuration and debug messages → `debug!()` 
- Connection status and success messages → `info!()`
- Reconnection attempts and warnings → `warn!()`
- Failed connections and critical errors → `error!()`

## Result
- TUI output is now properly contained within ratatui panels
- Important logs are still captured but filtered by level
- No more stdout breaking the TUI interface
- Can adjust log level via `RUST_LOG` environment variable if needed

## Log Level Strategy
- Set to "error" by default to minimize TUI disruption
- Only critical errors will be displayed outside the TUI
- Debug and info messages are suppressed during TUI operation
- Can change to "debug" or "info" for troubleshooting when not using TUI

## Testing
The enhanced events test script (`test_enhanced_events.bat`) now properly demonstrates contained TUI output without frame breaking.
