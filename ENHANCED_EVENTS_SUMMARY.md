# Enhanced Move/Resize Events Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended IPC Protocol (`src/ipc.rs`)

**Enhanced WindowEvent struct:**
- Added grid coordinates: `grid_top_left_row`, `grid_top_left_col`, `grid_bottom_right_row`, `grid_bottom_right_col`
- Added real window bounds: `real_x`, `real_y`, `real_width`, `real_height`
- Added monitor tracking: `monitor_id`
- Extended event types:
  - 0 = created
  - 1 = destroyed  
  - 2 = moved
  - 3 = state_changed
  - **4 = move_start** (NEW)
  - **5 = move_stop** (NEW)
  - **6 = resize_start** (NEW)
  - **7 = resize_stop** (NEW)

**Enhanced GridEvent enum:**
- All window events now include complete position data
- Added new event variants: `WindowMoveStart`, `WindowMoveStop`, `WindowResizeStart`, `WindowResizeStop`
- Each event includes both grid coordinates and real window bounds

### 2. Updated Event Processing

**IPC Server (`src/ipc_server.rs`):**
- Updated `grid_event_to_window_event` conversion to handle new event types
- Enhanced convenience methods to include position data (placeholder values for now)

**IPC Client (`src/ipc_client.rs`):**
- Ready to receive and process enhanced event data
- Background monitoring automatically handles new event types

### 3. New Real-time Monitor (`realtime_monitor_grid.rs`)

**Key Fix: All output is now contained within the ratatui interface!**
- **No more breaking out of frames** - stdout output from GridClient is managed
- **Split-panel TUI** with proper boundaries:
  - Top panel: Multi-monitor grid visualization  
  - Bottom panel: Real-time event log
- **Multi-monitor support:** Displays all monitors horizontally
- **Enhanced event tracking:** Shows grid coordinates, real bounds, and event types
- **Interactive controls:**
  - `h` - Toggle help screen
  - `q` - Quit
  - `a` - Toggle auto-scroll logs
  - `c` - Clear event logs
  - `←/→` - Switch between monitors

**Grid Visualization Improvements:**
- **Window border rendering:** Shows window boundaries with box-drawing characters
- **Enhanced color coding:** Different colors for different window states:
  - Blue: Created windows
  - Cyan: Moved windows  
  - Yellow: Moving/resizing in progress
  - Green: Move/resize completed
  - Dark gray: Empty cells
- **Window info display:** Shows HWND, dimensions, position, and grid coordinates
- **Self-contained interface:** All grid and event data displayed within panels

### 4. Dependencies Added

**Cargo.toml:**
- Added `ratatui = "0.28"` for terminal UI
- Added binary entry for `realtime_monitor_grid`

### 5. Test Scripts

**run_realtime_monitor.bat:**
- Quick script to launch the real-time monitor

**test_enhanced_events.bat:**
- Comprehensive test that starts server and monitor
- Tests the full enhanced event pipeline

## Usage

### Start Real-time Monitor
```bash
# Option 1: Direct run
cargo run --bin realtime_monitor_grid

# Option 2: Use batch script
run_realtime_monitor.bat

# Option 3: Full test with server
test_enhanced_events.bat
```

### Server-side Event Generation
The server will now generate enhanced events with:
- Precise grid coordinates for window placement
- Real window bounds (pixel coordinates)
- Start/stop events for move and resize operations
- Monitor ID for multi-monitor setups

### Client-side Event Processing
Clients can now:
- Track exact window positions in both grid and real coordinates
- Detect move/resize start/stop for smooth UI updates
- Maintain accurate grid state sync across multiple monitors
- Handle enhanced position data for better layout management

## Benefits

1. **Better Grid Sync:** Clients can maintain precise grid state with start/stop events
2. **Enhanced Position Data:** Both grid and real coordinates available for all events
3. **Multi-monitor Support:** Monitor ID tracking enables per-monitor grid management
4. **Real-time Visualization:** Live monitoring of all grid events with enhanced data
5. **Improved Client Experience:** Start/stop events allow for smoother UI transitions

## Future Enhancements

The enhanced event structure is designed to support:
- Window animation tracking during moves/resizes
- Precise grid cell occupancy calculation
- Multi-monitor window spanning detection
- Advanced layout restoration capabilities
- Performance monitoring of window operations

This implementation provides the foundation for robust, real-time grid state synchronization across all connected clients.
