# Focus Event Integration - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully integrated comprehensive focus event tracking into the main e_grid server infrastructure. The main server (`ipc_server_demo`) now publishes both FOCUSED and DEFOCUSED events, matching the functionality of the standalone `focus_demo_server`.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Server Infrastructure (`src/ipc_server.rs`)
- ✅ Added `focus_publisher` field to `GridIpcServer` struct
- ✅ Added `last_focused_window` field for tracking focus changes
- ✅ Registered focus events service in `setup_services()`
- ✅ Updated service listing to include focus events
- ✅ Enhanced `handle_window_event()` to track focus changes:
  - Sends DEFOCUSED event for previous window
  - Sends FOCUSED event for current window
  - Tracks window transitions properly

### 2. Event Types Supported
- ✅ **FOCUSED (0)** - When a window gains focus
- ✅ **DEFOCUSED (1)** - When a window loses focus  
- ✅ **Window details** - Process ID, window title, hashes
- ✅ **Timestamps** - For event ordering and timing

### 3. Multi-Client Support
- ✅ **Up to 8 simultaneous clients** per service
- ✅ **Message history** for late-joining clients
- ✅ **Individual client buffers** to prevent blocking
- ✅ **Graceful client disconnect/reconnect**

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `test_focus_defocus.bat` for easy testing
- ✅ Updated `examples/README.md` with new capabilities
- ✅ Created `test_focus_integration.bat` for end-to-end testing

## 🎯 Event Flow

```
Windows Focus Change
         ↓
EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND (WinEvent hook)
         ↓
handle_window_event()
         ↓
1. Publish DEFOCUSED for previous window (if any)
2. Update last_focused_window  
3. Publish FOCUSED for current window
         ↓
IPC Service: GRID_FOCUS_EVENTS_SERVICE
         ↓
All connected clients receive events
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test with main server + client
test_focus_defocus.bat

# Test server-client integration  
test_focus_integration.bat

# Use existing demo scripts
run_demos.bat
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start main server
cargo run --bin ipc_server_demo

# Terminal 2: Start focus demo client
cargo run --example simple_focus_demo

# Then click on different windows to see FOCUSED/DEFOCUSED events
```

## 📈 Capability Comparison

| Feature | focus_demo_server | ipc_server_demo (main) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| FOCUSED events | ✅ | ✅ |
| DEFOCUSED events | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-client | ✅ | ✅ |
| Window details | ✅ | ✅ |
| Process tracking | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hash identification | ✅ | ✅ |
| Grid management | ❌ | ✅ |
| Layout support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Animation support | ❌ | ✅ |
| Production ready | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🏆 Result

The main e_grid server now provides **complete focus event tracking** with both FOCUSED and DEFOCUSED events, making the standalone `focus_demo_server` optional for most use cases. The main server is the recommended choice for production applications as it provides the full e_grid feature set with integrated focus tracking.

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Performance optimization** - Add focus event batching if needed
2. **Additional event types** - Window minimize/restore focus events  
3. **Focus history** - Maintain focus event history service
4. **Enhanced filtering** - Allow clients to filter by process/window type
5. **Documentation** - Update main README with focus tracking capabilities

All core focus tracking functionality is now complete and ready for use! 🎉
